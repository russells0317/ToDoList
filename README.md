# ToDoList
<img src= "Screenshot.png" />

## Description of Project
In this exercise we were utilizing and learning how to create a list and manipulate it through the React DOM. By creating the To-Do List, we were able to add/remove items, change the layout/font styles and customize it to the creator's liking.

## Improvements
Unfortunately, I was unable to adjust and alter the list to have a specific background color or photo. Due to the deadline submission, I was only able to submit the basic list layout. I hope to return to this project to adjust the font styles and add a more colorful or picture background.
